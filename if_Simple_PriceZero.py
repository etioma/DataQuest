In the code editor, we've already initialized the variable a_price with a value of 0. Transcribe the following sentences into code by making use of if statements:

1. If a_price is equal to 0, then print the string 'This is free' (remember to use the == operator for equality).
2. If a_price is equal to 1, then print the string 'This is not free'.
